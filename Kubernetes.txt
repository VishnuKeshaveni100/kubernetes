CREATING EKS CLUSTER WITH 3 WORKER NODES AND DEPLOYING IMAGE IN THE WORKER NODE USING NODESELECTOR ON AWS
########################################################################################################

# 3 WAYS OF CREATING EKS CLUSTER

# 1 WAY: a) AWS Management Console

          - create AWS account with Admin Privileges
		  - AWS Cli Access to use Kubectl utility
		  - Instance (To manage cluster by using Kubectl)
		  - create a VPC
		  - create an IAM role with Security Group (or in other words: create AWS user with list of permissions)
		  
       b) Create cluster on control plane
	   
	      - choose basic information like cluster name and k8s version
          - choose region and VPC for your cluster
          - set security
		  - Install& Setup IAM Authenticator and kubectl Utility
		  
	   c) Create worker nodes and Connect to Cluster (The Worker Nodes are some EC2 instances with CPU and storage resources.)
	     
		  - Create IAM Roler EKS Worker Nodes
		  - Create as a Node Group (WOrker nodes)
          - Choose cluster it will attach to
          - Define Security Group, select instance type etc.
	   	  
        With NodeGroup you have autoscaling, which means based on your needs depending on how much load the cluster has new Worker Nodes will automatically added or removed in the cluster.

        - For that you need to define max and minimum number of Nodes.

        --------  Complex, but powerful and popular -------- 
		
        You're right, that's a lot of effort for just creating a simple Kubernetes cluster. Compared to other managed Kubernetes services, like DigitalOcean or Linode it's more complex.

        So, how to do it, when you just want to create a cluster and start deploying your containers inside as fast as possible. 

        Instead of doing all those steps manually, there is a faster and more efficient way.
 
# 2 WAY: a) Use eksctl to Create Cluster

        eksctl is a simple CLI tool for creating clusters on EKS. With just one command you create a cluster in minutes.

PREREQUISITES:    

        - AWS CLI Access with Admin Privileges.
		- One instance (AWS Cli must have installed)
		- SSH Key (Optional To allow remote ssh to worker nodes)
		
STEPS iNVOLVED:

		- Install Eksctl and Kubectl utility
		- Create Eks Cluster using Eksctl utility
		- Deploying Demo Application
		
# 3 WAY: a) Iac (Terraform, ansible)
